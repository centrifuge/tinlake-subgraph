  # Order Management
  # Users can submit supplyOrder or redeemOrder to change their investment in the pool:
  # 1) A user can supply DAI which goes into the `pendingSupplyCurrency`
  # 2) After each epoch some or all of the pendingSupplyCurrency can be converted to pool shares (DROP/TIN) or some or all of the pendingRedeemToken can be converted to DAI. After each epoch the fulfillment percentage can increase.
  # 3) Calling calcDisburse() gives you 4 values:
  #    - pendingSupplyCurrency: the amount of DAI not converted to tokens yet
  #    - supplyAmount: the amount of DROP/TIN you will get the next time you call `disburse`
  #    - pendingRedeemToken: the amount of tokens not redeemed to DAI yet
  #    - redeemAmount: the amount of DAI you will get next time you call `disburse`
  # 4) Calling `disburse` will send all of the above balances to the user (token & currency)
